# Module 02: Software Skills I
It’s nice to refresh my knowledge on modules and packaging python files for applications. In the MSDS program, I’ve only ever done it for one project and always wanted to tackle something like that again. 

I’ve never heard of Tmux before but after reading more I’m eager to try it out. However, I still do not see its usefulness as of right now. I can open multiple instances of my current terminal and it seems that it serves the same purpose. Unless there is more to Tmux than meets the eye? Maybe it is a better way to “monitor” terminal instances and keep track of kernel command history?

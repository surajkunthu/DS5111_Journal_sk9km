# Module 05: Software Testing

I have dealt with Software Testing before and I believe it is an extremely valuable part of software development. In the MSDS program, we've only written unit tests for our final project in DS 5100 with `pytest`. In my day job, my team primarily writes code in TypeScript/JavaScript and we utilize `Jest.js` to write our test suites.

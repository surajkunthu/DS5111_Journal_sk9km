# Module 01: Git Fundamentals, Setting up github repository and AWS login

I’m excited to learn more about Data Engineering and the back end! Fortunately, I’m coming in with some experience with Git and GitHub so reading the text was more of a refresher than anything else. I’ve never touched any AWS services so it’s exciting to be able to experiment within an instance. I thought learning about makefile’s was interesting. I knew shell scripts (.sh) were used for automation purposes but never heard of makefiles.

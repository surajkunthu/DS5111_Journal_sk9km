# Module 03: Software Skills II

It was useful to learn more about decorators in Python. I've heard about them before but never used them. I can definitely see how they would be useful as it provides a better way to chain functions together for modifying an object's structure. The Python decorator provides a cleaner way for this implementation that would help reduce redundancy and make code DRY with the `@` symbol:

```python
@testfunction1
def test:
    print("hi")
```
